To apply for the refund of withholding tax, tax bureau in different countries have different forms to fill. It may take you days even weeks to find the correct tax form and fill it. 

For America, the [W-8BEN](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw8ben.pdf) should be completed at first, which would allow your dividends to be taxed at the 15% treaty rate rather than the full 30%. If you do not complete the form in advance but discover the error before the end of the same tax year, you may simply be able to complete the W-8BEN and request a refund of the additional withholding tax from the paying agent.

If you do not resolve the problem in time, the IRS guidance is to complete a US income tax return and request a refund. This will usually be a [1040NR ](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040nr.pdf) but may be the simplified [1040NR-EZ](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040nre.pdf)  if you meet certain conditions.

For Canada, pre-emptive relief is available through the [NR301 form](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/cra-arc/formspubs/pbg/nr301/nr301-13e.pdf). Alternatively, you can reclaim withholding tax by completing the [NR7-R form](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/cra-arc/formspubs/pbg/nr7-r/nr7-r-17e.pdf). The standard treaty rate is 15%, versus 25% without relief.

For France, you require a [Form 5000](http://www.ambafrance-uk.org/IMG/pdf_Formulaire_5000_EN.pdf) to establish your residence status and a [Form 5001](http://www.ambafrance-uk.org/IMG/pdf_5001.pdf) to reclaim the withholding tax. As outlined in the guidance notes, completing form 5000 in advance should enable you to receive dividends with only the 15% treaty rate deducted at source.

For Spain, [Form 210](https://www2.agenciatributaria.gob.es/wlpl/OV17-M210/index.zul) is used for tax refund(available in Spanish only). 

For Switzerland, there are different [forms](https://www.estv.admin.ch/estv/en/home/internationales-steuerrecht/dienstleistungen/publikationen-und-formulare-bestellen/quellensteuerabkommen.html) for other nationalities. The standard Swiss withholding tax is 35%. You need to choose the correct form very carefully based on your nationalities. 

For Germany, the relevant information is on the tax office website. You can download the [form](http://www.bzst.de/EN/Steuern_International/Kapitalertragsteuerentlastung/Auslaendische_Antragsteller/Formulare/KapSt_Ausl_Formulare_node.html) based on your actual condition.

For Ireland, there is an explanation of the dividend withholding tax system [here](https://www.revenue.ie/en/companies-and-charities/dividend-withholding-tax/index.aspx). You can follow the structure and download form as you need. 

For Sweden, reclaims can be made using form [SKV3740](https://www.skatteverket.se/download/18.34f3b0b713e2cf5455bd/1366608077069/374019.pdf). 

For Finland, reclaims require a form [6161e](https://www.vero.fi/en/About-us/contact-us/forms/descriptions/certificate_of_tax_treatment_concerning/) to be completed by HMRC and a [6164e](https://www.vero.fi/en/About-us/contact-us/forms/descriptions/application_for_refund_of_finnish_withh/) by the claimant (or a [6167e](https://www.vero.fi/en/About-us/contact-us/forms/descriptions/application_for_refund_of_finnish_withh/) if there are multiple dividends). To apply for the refund, the Finland Tax Bureau may request for the certification that the income has been taxed in your country of residence.
