        %h2 About Protocol

        -# %img{ src: "/images/protocol-logo-highres.png", alt: "Protocol: Automated WHT recovery" }

        %p.introduction
          Protocol is a web based software platform that automates worldwide withholding tax (“WHT”) recovery. It is a cloud solution, securely accessible from any place in the world that has an internet connection.

        %h4 Why did we design Protocol?
        %p
          Protocol has been designed for pension funds. For purposes of risk management and diversification, pension funds invest the funds entrusted to them in a wide variety of asset classes and countries. Equity and fixed income form the vast majority of their assets. The return on equity (dividend or dividend equivalent) and fixed income (interest or interest equivalent) is subject to a WHT in most countries around the world, ranging from 10% to 30% of the gross return.
        %p
          Because of their public interest and not-for-profit character, pension funds have a tax profile that is different from other investors. This special tax profile grants pension funds specific entitlements to reduction or even full refund of the withholding tax. For pension funds, the reduction or refund of WHT is quintessential, as they do not have any income tax liability against which to credit the WHT. Recovering the WHT directly improves the return on investment by 10 – 30%. And because of the sheer size of pension funds and their investments, the amounts of unclaimed WHT are very substantial, which makes the added value of using Protocol self-evident.


        %h4 For whom did we design Protocol?
        %p
          Tax administrations around the world are unable to agree on uniform and standard WHT recovery entitlement and procedure for pension funds. The entitlement to reduction or refund, the procedure, the documentation and the statute of limitations is different in every country, which makes it virtually impossible for pension funds to get a solid grip on their WHT recovery. WHT recovery is a complex, burdensome and costly exercise. As a result, pension funds are missing out on WHT refund opportunities, on a massive scale. Our extensive and in-depth experience in WHT recovery has shown us the path to the solution to this problem: Protocol

            Protocol intuitively guides pension funds through automated worldwide WHT recovery. Depending on whether or not investments are pooled, the recovery process comprises three or four steps.

            Protocol is  a two-edged sword that minimizes the time, effort, and expense required for preparing and filing WHT refund claims, while at the same time increasing the WHT recovery revenue.
