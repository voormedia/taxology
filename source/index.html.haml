        %h2 About Protocol

        %section
          %p.introduction
            Protocol is a web based software platform that automates global withholding tax (“WHT”) recovery. It is a cloud solution, securely accessible from any place in the world that has an internet connection.

          %p
            Protocol has been designed for pension funds. In addition to pension funds, it can be used by pension investment managers, custodians, and tax advisors who are responsible for the WHT recovery of pension funds.

        %section
          %h4 Why did we design Protocol?
          %p
            There is no global standard procedure for WHT recovery. The right to a reduction or refund of WHT, the recovery procedure, the documentation requirements and the statutes of limitations are different in every country, and change periodically. This makes it virtually impossible for pension funds and their investment managers, custodians, and tax advisors to get a solid grip on WHT recovery. As a result, pension funds are missing out on WHT refund opportunities, on a very large scale. Our extensive and in-depth experience in WHT recovery for pension funds has shown us the path to the solution to this problem: Protocol.

            Protocol intuitively guides pension investment managers through automated global WHT recovery. Depending on whether or not investments are pooled, the recovery process comprises three or four steps.

            Protocol is  a two-edged sword that minimizes the time, effort, and expense required for preparing and filing WHT refund claims, while at the same time increasing the WHT recovery revenue.
